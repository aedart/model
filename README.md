## Acknowledgement ##

Crafting small interfaces and traits, containing a few methods, is rather a trivial and easy task. That being said, ensuring that the data validity is an entirely different matter. Without certain individuals within the PHP community, making these packages would have been impossible for me. I would like to thank all those who that have spent countless hours, days, months and years on developing great packages and for sharing them with the rest of the world.

If you are interested in a more saturated list of names, please review the acknowledgement-section found in each Aedart/Model sub-package.

Did I forget to add your name in one of my packages? Please let me know...
