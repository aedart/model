## When to use this ##

Unless you are working on a very large and complex system, one that requires several different types models, ... well, perhaps you can settle for just what you need. Please take a closer look at [what this package contains](https://bitbucket.org/aedart/model/overview#markdown-header-what-does-this-package-contain).

## How to install ##

```
#!console

composer require 
```

This package uses [composer](https://getcomposer.org/). If you do not know what that is or how it works, I recommend that you read a little about, before attempting to use this package.

## Quick start ##

## What does this package contain ##

As mentioned, by itself, this package does not offer much more than a composer file, which requires several smaller packages, each situated within the `Aedart\Model` namespace. Listed below are those dependencies.

@todo ... Include a list (alphabetically sorted) / link / Mini-description to each published sub-package 

## Acknowledgement ##

Crafting small interfaces and traits, containing a few methods, is rather a trivial and easy task. That being said, ensuring that the data validity is an entirely different matter. Without certain individuals within the PHP community, making these packages would have been impossible for me. I would like to thank all those who that have spent countless hours, days, months and years on developing great packages and for sharing them with the rest of the world.

If you are interested in a more saturated list of names, please review the acknowledgement-section found in each `Aedart\Model` sub-package.

Did I forget to add your name in one of my packages? Please let me know...
